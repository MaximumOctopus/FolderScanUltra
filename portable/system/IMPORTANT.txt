Xinorbis will save your extensions in here if you select to use "portable mode", where everything gets saved to an ini file and here.

If Xinorbis cannot find these files then it will go to:

\system\defaultextensions

and load them from there. The Xinorbis installer will upadte the files in \system\defaultextensions, so keep a copy if you edit things, in fact keep a copy of both sets, just in case!!
